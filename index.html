    <h1>WHAT STARTED INSIDE THE MINDS PODCAST?</h1>
    <p>Sometimes, people are just meant to meet. Ryan started a podcast called "3rd and Won" during some free time after the Covid-19 pandemic started. Ryan and his girlfriend Jenny would go to CFL Football games in Vancouver, and meet with players outside of the stadium. He would always have something he would want to say or ask to the players he talked to, but with games being cancelled, this was no longer an option. One day while listening to the Joe Rogan Experience podcast during a workout, Ryan decided to start his own podcast. The "3rd and Won Podcast" was born soon after. Ryan came up with the name, his girlfriend Jenny designed the logo and colors with no prior experience. Ryan's plan was to interview professional athletes about their careers, as a way to fill the void of not meeting players at stadiums. Dante Marsh was one of the first athletes on the podcast, and after noticing their chemistry together, Dante agreed to join Ryan as a co-host. Soon after, the two decided to start their own show together, called Inside the Minds Podcast. Dante and Ryan came up with the name, Ryan's girlfriend Jenny again designed the logo and color scheme, and the rest is what you'd call history. The show is a way to give professional athletes, a platform to talk about their careers, stories, positive or negative experiences, setbacks, triumphs, or anything else they want to talk about. Not every pro athlete is a dumb jock. Not every pro athlete is consumed of nothing but themselves.</p>
